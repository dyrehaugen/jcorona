We start out by getting the data running debian/linux bash shell:                                                              
$ clone https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data                                                                     
# For later updating:
$ cd covid19-daily-data
$ git pull origin
# These are the files we get:                                                                                                 
$ ls covid19-daily-data                                                                                                        
misc  README.md  time_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv  time_series_19-covid-Deaths.csv  time_series_19-covid-Recovered.csv       
                                                                                                                               
Now we can look into the time series of confirmed cases, running Julia:
